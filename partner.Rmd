## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


What did Owner do in the most recent commit? What is the commit ID?
```
The owner pushed his hw1 and commit ID is 6ea6cb1e13e30ca3a0e4eafc4f9bb32aa54c45d3
```
Knit the Ownerâ€™s hw1.Rmd. Are you able to do so without error? If you cannot, what errors did you encounter?
```
